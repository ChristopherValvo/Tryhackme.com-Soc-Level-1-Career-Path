The Tools I Learned and Used

Here’s a breakdown of the main tools I used along the way. Think of them as my personal SOC toolbox.

Cyber Threat Intelligence Tools

YARA – My go-to for writing rules to hunt down threats.

MISP – Helped me share and pull threat intel from other analysts.

OpenCTI – A solid platform for organizing and managing all that threat intel data.

Network Security and Traffic Analysis

Snort – Helped me analyze network traffic and create IDS/IPS signatures.

NetworkMiner – Great for digging into network forensics and reconstructing traffic.

Zeek (Bro) – Used to monitor traffic and detect weird stuff going on.

Wireshark – The classic packet capture tool. Learned a ton from this one.

TShark – The command-line version of Wireshark when I didn’t want a GUI.

Brim – My sidekick for digging through PCAP files and investigating traffic.

Endpoint Security Monitoring

Sysinternals Suite – Helped me monitor Windows processes and find abnormal activity.

Sysmon – Gave me detailed logs on what’s happening at the system level.

Osquery – Basically let me query an endpoint like a database to check for issues.

Wazuh – Another strong tool for endpoint detection and response.

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

Splunk – My bread and butter for searching logs and hunting down incidents.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) – Another powerful tool for log ingestion and visualization.

Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

Autopsy – Used to analyze forensic disk images.

Redline – Helped me pull and investigate memory data from endpoints.

Volatility – Dug deep into memory forensics with this one.

Velociraptor – One of my favorites for endpoint monitoring and forensic data collection.

KAPE – Made it easy to gather forensic artifacts off systems.

Phishing Analysis Tools

MISP – Yep, I used this for phishing investigations too.

Email Header Analyzers – Helped me break down email headers and spot spoofing attempts.

URL Scanners (like VirusTotal) – A must for checking if links are sketchy or not.

Miscellaneous Tools

Wireshark and TShark – Still my go-to for traffic analysis.

Brim – Came in handy for PCAP analysis and log reviews.

Velociraptor – Used again for endpoint threat hunting.

Splunk and ELK – Always in the mix for logs and SIEM work.

All these tools gave me a strong foundation in threat hunting, traffic analysis, endpoint security, incident response, and phishing investigation.
