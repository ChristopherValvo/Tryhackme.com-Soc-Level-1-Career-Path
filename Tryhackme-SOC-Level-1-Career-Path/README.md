# TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Career Path

Imagine stepping into the cybersecurity world for the first time, where terms like firewalls, logs, and alerts felt completely foreign. That was me starting the SOC Level 1 path on TryHackMe. With nothing but curiosity (and a little panic), I jumped straight into a world of phishing kits, suspicious traffic, and constant threats. I ended up learning the ropes with tools like Snort (not a Pokémon, by the way) and Wireshark (it’s not about sharks, it’s about packets). Against the odds, I came out of it with real, hands-on skills.
