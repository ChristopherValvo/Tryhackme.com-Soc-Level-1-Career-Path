The Skills I Picked Up

Here’s the breakdown of what I actually learned in this whole journey:

1. Alert Monitoring and Triage
I got good at watching and sorting through security alerts from a ton of sources. My job was to figure out which ones were urgent and needed escalation.
Tools: Splunk, ELK.

2. Incident Response
I learned how to investigate possible breaches, figure out what happened, and take action to contain or stop the threat.
Tools: Splunk, ELK, Redline, Volatility, Velociraptor.

3. Network Traffic Analysis
I got comfortable breaking down network traffic and finding weird patterns that signaled attacks like malware, data leaks, or DDoS.
Tools: Wireshark, Zeek, NetworkMiner, Snort, TShark.

4. Log Analysis
I dug through logs from firewalls, servers, and endpoints to spot anything shady happening inside a network.
Tools: Splunk, Brim, ELK, Wazuh, Osquery.

5. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
I learned how to pull and analyze memory, disk, and registry data to investigate incidents and track down attackers.
Tools: Autopsy, Redline, KAPE, Velociraptor, Volatility.

6. Phishing Email Analysis
I broke down phishing emails to figure out what they were trying to do and where they came from. Sometimes it felt like solving puzzles.
Tools: MISP, VirusTotal, email header analyzers.

7. Threat Intelligence and IOCs
I got hands-on with collecting and using threat intel. I learned how to track bad guys using hashes, IPs, domains, and other indicators.
Tools: YARA, MISP, OpenCTI.

8. IDS/IPS Rule Writing
I wrote Snort rules to catch or block attacks in real time as they hit the network.
Tools: Snort.

9. Endpoint Security and Monitoring
I learned how to monitor endpoint activity and spot strange processes or behaviors before they turned into big problems.
Tools: Sysinternals Suite, Sysmon, Osquery, Wazuh.

10. Cyber Kill Chain and Pyramid of Pain
I learned how attackers think and operate across the different stages of an attack. I also learned how to frustrate them by removing their tools and techniques.
Concepts: Cyber Kill Chain, Pyramid of Pain.

11. Malware Analysis (Basic)
I learned the basics of how to break down malware files and figure out what they’re designed to do.
Tools: YARA, Volatility, Redline, VirusTotal.

12. Security Policies and Frameworks
I got familiar with the major frameworks and standards that guide SOC work and threat hunting (NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, Unified Kill Chain).
Concepts: NIST, MITRE ATT&CK, Unified Kill Chain.
